When you have a subproject under the SDCA project database, it is also possible to access the Danish Health Data Authority's national registers. Some of these registers can be found in the project database. Regardless of whether the registers are part of the project database or not, you must always apply directly to the Danish Health Data Authority for permission to use the data. 

On this page you will find all the necessary information about DHDA related to your subproject under the project database.
