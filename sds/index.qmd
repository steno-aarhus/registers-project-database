At the Danish Health Data Authority it is possible to apply for data from the national health registries for your research project. 
A number of these registers are available in the project database, but it is also possible to purchase registers for your project that are not available in the project database. On this page you will find a description of the registers available in the project database and information about the application procedure for SDS.
