If you want to set up a project under the project database or need to work on an already existing project you have to become a registered user at Statistics Denmark. This requires a couple of steps.

## Affiliation agreement

The first step is to get an affiliation agreement to SDCA's authorization at dst (aut. 574) and you get created as a user in Danmarks Datavindue - DDV. If you previously have been a registered user at Statistics Denmark, you can use dst ident from there. Otherwise we need the following informations to get you registrered:
  -    Full name
  -    E mail adresse
  -    Phone number



To get set up as a user, you can either contact Kasper (mail: kanoan@rm.dk) or Marie (mail: maipee@rm.dk). We will then get you set up as a user in DDV and introduce you to what is required to work with microdata on Statistics Denmark's server.  

Once your affiliation agreement is approved, you can log in to Remote.dst.dk and then DDV. Read more about how to log in to DDV for the first time here:

The first time you log in, you need to approve your user agreement. It will pop up automatically. To get final access to data, you need to pass a certification quiz about the data security rules at dst with 10 questions. You can read more about the quiz here:
