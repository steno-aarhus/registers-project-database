description: Information on how to get access to Statistics Denmark

If you want to set up a project under the project database or need to work on an already existing project you have to become a registered user at Statistics Denmark.

This requires that you get an affiliation agreement to SDCA's authorization at dst (aut. 574) and you get created as a user in Danmarks Datavindue - DDV. If you have an dst ident from previous you can use this.  

To get set up as a user, you can either contact Kasper (mail: kanoan@rm.dk) or Marie (mail: maipee@rm.dk). We will then get you set up as a user in DDV and introduce you to what is required to work with microdata on Statistics Denmark's server.  

Once your affiliation agreement is approved, you can log in to Remote.dst.dk and then DDV. Read more about how to log in to DDV for the first time here:

The first time you log in, you need to approve your user agreement. It will pop up automatically. To get final access to data, you need to pass a certification quiz about the data security rules at dst with 10 questions. You can read more about the quiz here:
