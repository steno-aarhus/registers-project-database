Statistics Denmark's microdatabase schemes provide data for specific research projects for authorized institutions. It is not allowed to conduct research directly on the project database, which is why sub-projects must be set up.

On this page you will find all the necessary information about Statistics Denmark related to your sub-project under the project database.
